    "\n",
    "We have seen that a given curve many be parameterized many different ways, and that the parameterization affects the speed at which the curve is traversed. Arc length parameterization is a special type of parameterization such that the curve is traversed at unit speed (that is, for every unit increase in the parameter we travel one unit of distance along the curve). Such parameterisations can also be used to calculate the curvature of a curve at a point: the rate at which the curve (and its tangent vector) changes direction at that point. For more details see Thomas 13.4."
