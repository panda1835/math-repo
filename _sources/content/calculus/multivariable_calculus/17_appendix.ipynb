For a continuous distribution of charge with charge density $\\rho$, the charge in a volume element $d V$ is $d Q=\\rho d V$ and the charge in a volume $\\mathrm{V}$ is $Q=\\iiint_{V} \\rho d V$.\n","\n","    Gauss's law (see VC4) states that for a closed surface $S$, the flux of the electric field $E$ through the surface is related to the charge Q enclosed by $\\iint_{S} \\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{E}} \\cdot d \\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{S}}=\\frac{Q}{\\epsilon_{0}}$ where $\\epsilon_{0}$ is a constant.\n","\n","    Hence we can write $\\iint_{S} \\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{E}} \\cdot d \\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{S}}=\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{0}} \\iiint_{V} \\rho d V$.\n","\n","    Meanwhile the divergence theorem states $\\iint_{S} \\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{E}} \\cdot d \\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{S}}=\\iiint \\vec{\\nabla} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{E}} d V$.\n","\n","    Comparing these equations we obtain $\\vec{\\nabla} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{E}}=\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_{0}}$, which is one of Maxwell's equations.\n","\n","    Since $\\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{E}}$ is conservative, we can also define an electric potential $\\phi$ by $\\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{E}}=-\\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}} \\phi$, and write $\\nabla^{2} \\phi=\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_{0}}$.\n","\n","2. Another of Maxwell's equations is $\\vec{\\nabla} \\times \\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{E}}=-\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial t}$.\n","\n","    In the absence of time-varying magnetic fields, this becomes $\\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}} \\times \\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{E}}=\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{0}}$.\n","\n","    By Stokes' theorem this is equivalent to saying $\\oint \\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{E}} \\cdot d \\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{r}}=0$ around any closed loop (an idea common used in analysing electrical circuits).\n","\n","3. Ampere's law states $\\oint_{C} \\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{B}} \\cdot d \\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{r}}=\\mu_{0} I$ where $I$ is the net current passing through a surface bounded by a closed curve $C$ and $\\mu_{0}$ is a constant.\n","\n","    For example, a constant current $I$ in a long wire produces a magnetic field tangential to any circle centered on and perpendicular to the wire, so by taking $C$ to be such a circle of radius $r$ we get $\\oint_{C} \\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{B}} \\cdot d \\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{r}}=B \\cdot 2 \\pi r=\\mu_{0} I$, and hence the magnetic field at a distance $r$ from the wire is $B=\\frac{\\mu_{0} I}{2 \\pi r}$.\n","\n","    See also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB83DpBJQsE 6:00 - 7:40.
